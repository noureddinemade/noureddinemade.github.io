        <h2>Ownership &amp; autonomy</h2>

        <p>
           If you decide to work with me, you will need to trust my judgement, my professional opinion and my experience. So if you ask me to solve a particular problem I need to have to be given the creative freedom (within reasonable bounderies) to be able to solve that problem and not be micromanaged.

        <h2>Remote &amp; flexible working</h2>

        <p>
           I&rsquo;ve freelanced for most of my career, I&rsquo;m well organised, I don&rsquo;t miss deadlines and I always deliver. If your company&rsquo;s thinking is that you are paying for me to be in an office every day from 9-5 rather than paying me to deliver then this absolutely will not work.

        <h2>Culture &amp; diversity</h2>

        <p>
            Are the majority of your managers, c-suite and board members white? Do you hire diversly but don&rsquo;t accomodate for that diversity? Does your company&rsquo;s social culture revolve heavily around getting drunk? At this stage of my career I don&rsquo;t want to be your company&rsquo;s token and I don&rsquo;t want to work with garbage people, so if the answer to any of those questions is a yes, then please stay away.

        <h2>Interviewing &amp; hiring</h2>

        <p>
            I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time carefully putting this portfolio together specifically for people wanting to work with me. It clearly highlights what, how and why. I&rsquo;d love to have a chat and run you through my work and process but if your hiring process requires that I perform a design task then I&rsquo;m afraid it won&rsquo;t work out.
