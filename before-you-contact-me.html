        <h2>1. Ownership &amp; autonomy</h2>

        <p>
           Don&rsquo;t worry, this doesn&rsquo;t mean that I get to come in and change anything and everything about your product, experience or brand. It means that if you decide to work with me, you trust my judgement and my professional experience. So if you ask me to solve a particular problem I need to be given the creative freedom to be able to solve that problem (within reasonable bounderies) and not be micromanaged.

        <h2>2. Remote &amp; flexible working</h2>

        <p>
           During the last 5 years I&rsquo;ve only worked at places that offer remote and flexible working. I don&rsquo;t miss deadlines and I deliver excellent results so if your company&rsquo;s thinking is that you are paying for me to be in an office every day from 9-5 rather than paying me to deliver then this absolutely will not work.

        <h2>3. Culture &amp; diversity</h2>

        <p>
            Are the majority of your managers, c-suite and board members white? Do you hire diversly but don&rsquo;t accomodate for that diversity? Does your company&rsquo;s social culture revolve heavily around getting drunk? At this stage of my career I don&rsquo;t want to be your company&rsquo;s token and I don&rsquo;t want to work with garbage people, so if the answer to any of those questions is a yes, then please stay away.

        <h2>4. Salary &amp; compensation</h2>

        <p>
           When it comes to salary, I&rsquo;ve not always been paid fairly so
