        <p class="intro fullWidth">
            Hi there, I&rsquo;m Noureddine. I&rsquo;ve spent the last fifteen years doing design, so presumably, I know what I&rsquo;m doing. And if that&rsquo;s not enough and you&rsquo;re still wondering if I know what design is, of course I do. It&rsquo;s two single colour shapes on a white background surrounded with lots of white space.
        </p>

        <p>
            Creative problem solving is at the heart of everything I do. Over the years, I finally figured out that my role is simple, I solve problems. For example, if someone has a squeaky door I would grease the hinges first then, I would cover the door with glitter, because design.
        </p>

        <p>
            When I&rsquo;m not designing, you can find me hanging out in Naarm (Melbourne) with my human lady friend and our cat Porchester. I like antique markets, rewatching dumb action movies, eating cone shaped ice cream and trying to make a board game.
