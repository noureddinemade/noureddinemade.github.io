        <p class="intro">
            Ever since I got my first job as a designer, I&rsquo;ve known that I was going to be a designer. It was one of those moments of clarity where I was like “I guess I&rsquo;ll do this now”. 
        </p>

        <p>
            I&rsquo;ve spent the last fifteen years doing design, so presumably, I know what I&rsquo;m doing. And if that&rsquo;s not enough and you&rsquo;re still wondering if I know what design is, of course I do. It&rsquo;s two black squares in the middle of a white sheet with a bunch of space around them. 
        </p>

        <p>
            In those fifteen years I&rsquo;ve worked on a bunch of stuff including designing a website for the New Zealand All Blacks, working at a dogshit start up now called Pollen, teaching design at General Assembly, branding a huge digital pharmacy, AND coming up with this list.
        </p>

        <p>
            When I&rsquo;m not designing, you can find me hanging out with my partner and our cat. Maybe we&rsquo;re rewatching Lost and I&rsquo;m getting mad at Sayid&rsquo;s terrible Arabic. Maybe we&rsquo;re watching football, and by we I mean me. Maybe I&rsquo;m eating a cone shaped ice cream. The point is, I&rsquo;m doing stuff and I don&rsquo;t need to prove it.
