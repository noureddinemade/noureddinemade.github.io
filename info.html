                I&rsquo;ve spent the last fifteen years doing design, so presumably, I know what I&rsquo;m doing. And if that&rsquo;s not enough and you&rsquo;re still wondering if I know what design is, of course I do. It&rsquo;s two single colour shapes on a white background surrounded with lots of white space.

                In those fifteen years I&rsquo;ve worked on a bunch of stuff including designing a website for the New Zealand All Blacks, working at a dogshit start up now called Pollen, teaching design at General Assembly, branding a huge digital pharmacy, AND coming up with this list.

                Creative problem solving is at the heart of everything I do. Over the years, as titles changed and technology evolved, I figured out that my role is simple, I try and solve problems. So, being a designer, to me, means solving problems but in a creative way. Am I rambling yet? So as an example, if someone wanted their door to stop squeaking I would grease the hinges (obviously) but then I would also cover the door with glitter, because design.

            When I&rsquo;m not designing, you can find me hanging out with my partner and our cat. Maybe we&rsquo;re rewatching Lost and I&rsquo;m getting mad at Sayid&rsquo;s terrible Arabic. Maybe we&rsquo;re watching football, and by we I mean me. Maybe I&rsquo;m eating a cone shaped ice cream. The point is, I&rsquo;m doing stuff and I don&rsquo;t need to prove it.
