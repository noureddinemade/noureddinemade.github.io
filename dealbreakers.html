        <h2>
            So, these are my dealbreakers. If the place you&rsquo;re hiring for has one, pretty please don&rsquo;t contact me. I&rsquo;m usually a very nice person but if you&rsquo;re from a company that has any of these dealbreakers and you contact me anyway, I will assume that you are a piece of shit and will respond in kind.

                <p>
                    I don&rsquo;t trust the judgement of an all white management team. So if the majority of your managers, c suite and board members are white, then I 100% don&rsquo;t want to be any where near your trash company.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <span class="count"></span>
                <p>
                    If you hire diversely but your space is not accomodating to us and our diversity, then obviously that means we are just an item on your cool PR checklist and that&rsquo;s super gross.
                </p>
                
            </li>
            
            <li>
                <span class="count"></span>
                <p>
                    Being the only non white person in a team is mentally exhausting. I&rsquo;ve experienced it, a lot. And honestly, I just don&rsquo;t have the energy to be your company&rsquo;s resident token.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <span class="count"></span>
                <p>
                    If your team building events revolve heavily around getting drunk because your CEO thinks this builds stronger teams, then that is not on brand for me and also, your CEO sucks.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <span class="count"></span>
                <p>
                    Does your CEO descirbe living in their parents guest house with absolute financial security and daddy helping them get their product off the ground as struggling? Then no thank you.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <span class="count"></span>
                <p>
                    If you don&rsquo;t offer flexible hours or remote working then no thanks. I don&rsquo;t want to be in a office all day so that Chad (your CPO I&rsquo;m assuming) can look over my shoulder all day.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <span class="count"></span>
                <p>
                    The vast majority of your employees don&rsquo;t like working outside of their normal working hours, so don&rsquo;t encourage this bullshit. Let them live their lives.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <span class="count"></span>
                <p>
                    You think these dealbreakers make me a difficult person to work with when really, I&rsquo;m a fucking treat to work with and you&rsquo;re genuine trash.
                </p>
