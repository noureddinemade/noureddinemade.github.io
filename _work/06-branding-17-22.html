            One of my favourite things to work on is branding. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, working on a project end to end is great but there&rsquo;s something about getting to focus on the visual storytelling of a brand. This collection of logos includes some of my favourite designs between 2016 and 2022. Not all of them ended up as the final design, some of them were just full on rejected but all of them were particular pieces of work that I felt proud of.
