        <p class="intro">
            The goal of this project was to create a new internal tool that can be used by the pharmacy, clinical and support teams to manage patients and orders. The tool needed to be simple and easy to understand and onboard new staff but could also handle complex tasks as well as automating a lot of the manual tasks whenever possible.
        </p>

        <p>
            This was needed because the existing tool was getting to the point of being virtually unusable and had started causing an unacceptable amount of errors. As we were in charge of getting medication to people, even 1 error was too many.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The existing tool was a mix of a lot of manual work and a tool that tries to do everything all at once. It couldn't scale with the business, it wasn't user friendly which made it hard to onboard new staff and it had loads of manual tasks that were either not needed or could be automated easily.

        <p class="intro">
            As we were in a very lucky position of having access to 100% of the users who will be using the product, I decided that before starting to even plan the project that I would take a few days to speak with at least 2 people in each of the departments that take care of a patients order from start to finish. While this was happening I also created a short survey comprised of 3 questions. Two multiple choice and 1 free text.

        <h2>
            Planning
        </h2>

        <p class="intro">
            After this was done it was time to start planning the project. My first activity was to run a workshop with both the co founders and team leads in the operational teams (pharmacy, clinical, support, warehouse). 
        </p>

        <p>
            The goal of this workshop was to define what the MVP would be, the key problems that needed to be solved and the metrics we would use to measure the success of our solutions.
        </p>

        <p>
            We decided that for the MVP, we would focus only on the core order flow of a NHS prescription order. This decision was made because it has the most complex flows and much of the automation that could be created for an NHS order would work perfectly for other order types.
        </p>

        <p>
            The main problems we wanted to solver were:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>The inability to find key pieces of information quickly</li>
            <li>Too much manual data entry</li>
            <li>Constant human errors</li>
            <li>Lack of automation</li>
        </ul>

            But will it actually work?
        </h2>

        <p class="intro">
            Before proceeding with this idea we needed to ensure that the internal teams actually understood the concept and this made sense with their work flows especially for the pharmacy team.
        </p>

        <p>
            We were in a very lucky position of having access to 100% of the users who will be using the product.
        </p>

        <p>
            I created a short survey that asked questions about the existing tool, current pain points and any ideas they had. The results of the survey aligned with most of the ideas that I had within the task based concept.

        <p>
            Over the next 2 weeks I ran 6 sessions with each one having different members from different internal teams. Before each session I sent rough wireframes and concepts for the teams to look through then during the sessions I guided them through the ideas and got them to give feedback on both the existing product.
        </p>

        <p>
            The findings from these sessions and the survey were pretty straight forward in terms of the main problems which were:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Hard to find things</li>
            <li>A lot of manual data entry</li>
            <li>Constant human errors</li>

            Now for the designs
        </h2>

        <p class="intro">
            After the sessions, we were in a really good place to start designs. To ensure that the designs reflected the feedback from the sessions along with the goal of creating a better system than the existing one, we started a weekly feedback loop.
        </p>

        <p>
            Every week I&rsquo;d send over wireframes, looms, designs and other ideas to the internal teams and would receive loads of helpful feedback.
        </p>

        <p>
            At this point, I had spent 6 weeks of research and initial designs. The designs were finally starting to take shape. The concept of the task based system was working very well and was understood really clearly.

            Being able to clearly describe designs is already a hard skill to learn. Being fully remote made this particular skill an even harder one to master. Especially working with a team that was all onsite or at least on the same timezone. Using Loom to record video explainers, walkthroughs, rants etc. made this process so simple.

        <h2>
            Conclusion
        </h2>

        <p class="intro">
            As the system is still being developed, the full version is still not available. However a light version was built using only a few of the basic tasks (Nominations & First Time Calls) and patient view. While this doesn&rsquo;t give us a full and clear picture of any improvements or failures, it has given us some insight into those specific tasks and the patient view.
        </p>

    </div>
    
    <div class="content">

        <h3>
            First time call task
        </h3>

        <p>
            Depending on the duration of the call, a patient care member could make around 12 first time calls in an hour. This number wasn&rsquo;t improved however the new system gave the patient care team a checklist for the information they needed to provide, a way of rescheduling the call so that they wouldn&rsquo;t have to follow up manually and it automated an informational email sent to the patient which provided dynamic information based on which items get checked off.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Nomination task
        </h3>

        <p>
            Using the old system a patient care member could do around 27 nominations per hour. But with the new system that number is over 50 per hour. This is due to the new system allowing for bulk copy and paste actions.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Patient view
        </h3>

        <p>
            The feedback received for the new patient seems to be that the problem of not being able to find information quickly seems to have been solved. Now obviously this doesn&rsquo;t speak for the entire system, but just one part of it.
        </p>

        <p class="intro">
            The data we&rsquo;ve gotten from the light version of the system has given us enough to already start improving on the above tasks and views as well as updating other general areas in the new system.
