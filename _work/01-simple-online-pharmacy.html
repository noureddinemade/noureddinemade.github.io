        <p class="intro">
            The goal was to create an internal system that was simple and easy to understand and onboard but could also handle complex tasks as well as automating a lot of the manual tasks whenever possible.
        </p>

        <p>
            Since we were also working on creating the NHS product for the business which allowed patients to request their repeat prescriptions through us we decided that the MVP for the internal system would be purely focused on NHS patients/orders with the long term goal of bringing all other patient and order types into the system.

        <h2>How it worked so far</h2>

        <p>
            The existing system was a mix of a lot of manual work and a tool that tries to do everything all at once. While this approach was currently working, there were major issues with it. It couldn't scale with the business, it wasn't user friendly which made it hard to onboard new staff and it had loads of manual tasks that were either not needed or could be automated easily.

        <h2>Where to start?</h2>

        <p>
            The flow of an NHS order was used to map out the core tasks that were needed for the MVP as well as figuring out what could and couldn't be automated.
        </p>

        <p>
            Unlike a regular ecommerce order, a patient's NHS order couldn't just go from the warehouse to the back of a truck to be shipped and because we were dealing with medication and regulatory pharmacy requirements, we could never have a fully automated system.

        <h2>But will it actually work?</h2>

        <p>
            Before proceeding with this idea we needed to ensure that the internal teams actually understood the concept and this made sense with their work flows especially for the pharmacy team.
        </p>

        <p>
            We were in a very lucky position of having access to 100% of the users who will be using the product.
        </p>

        <p>
            I created a short survey that asked questions about the existing tool, current pain points and any ideas they had. The results of the survey aligned with most of the ideas that I had within the task based concept.

        <p>
            Over the next 2 weeks I ran 6 sessions with each one having different members from different internal teams. Before each session I sent rough wireframes and concepts for the teams to look through then during the sessions I guided them through the ideas and got them to give feedback on both the existing product.
        </p>

        <p>
            The findings from these sessions and the survey were pretty straight forward in terms of the main problems which were:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                &bull; Hard to find things
            </li>
            <li>
                &bull; A lot of manual data entry
            </li>
            <li>
                &bull; Constant human errors
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Now for the designs</h2>

        <p>
            After the sessions, we were in a really good place to start designs. To ensure that the designs reflected the feedback from the sessions along with the goal of creating a better system than the existing one, we started a weekly feedback loop.
        </p>

        <p>
            Every week I'd send over wireframes, looms, designs and other ideas to the internal teams and would receive loads of helpful feedback.
        </p>

        <p>
            At this point, I had spent 6 weeks of research and initial designs. The designs were finally starting to take shape. The concept of the task based system was working very well and was understood really clearly.

        <p class="intro">
            Now was time to start working on the final designs for the MVP. I've always known that when it came to putting the UI together, it was going to be really plain (in the best way possible). There was no need for anything flash and it didn't need to reinvent the wheel.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>

        <p>
            As the system is still being developed, the full version is still not available. However a light version was built using only a few of the basic tasks (Nominations & First Time Calls) and patient view. While this doesn't give us a full and clear picture of any improvements or failures, it has given us some insight into those specific tasks and the patient view.
        </p>

        <h3>Nomination task</h3>

        <p>
            Using the old system a patient care member could do around 27 nominations per hour. But with the new system that number is over 50 per hour. This is due to the new system allowing for bulk copy and paste actions.
        </p>

        <h3>First time call task</h3>

        <p>
            Depending on the duration of the call, a patient care member could make around 12 first time calls in an hour. This number wasn't improved however the new system gave the patient care team a checklist for the information they needed to provide, a way of rescheduling the call so that they wouldn't have to follow up manually and it automated an informational email sent to the patient which provided dynamic information based on which items get checked off.
        </p>

        <h3>Patient view</h3>

        <p>
            The feedback received for the new patient seems to be that the problem of not being able to find information quickly seems to have been solved. Now obviously this doesn't speak for the entire system, but just one part of it.
        </p>

        <p>
            The data we've gotten from the light version of the system has given us enough to already start improving on the above tasks and views as well as updating other general areas in the new system.
        </p>
