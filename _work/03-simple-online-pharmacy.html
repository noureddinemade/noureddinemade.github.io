            The existing NHS product had a variety of UX issues as well as not being ready for the business to start scaling the NHS side.
        </p>

        <p>
            The web app had already had a lot of work done prior to my arrival so we wanted to focus on the app first, which had not been worked on since it was made.
        </p>

        <p>
            The goal of this project was to create a better experience for the NHS product, as well as creating a patient area that could cater to all areas of the business and not just for the NHS.

            However the MVP was focused on the main flows of the NHS product; sign up, add medication and request medication.

                There had already been a significant amount of research done prior to me and the timeframe to get the app designed was tight so I opted to not to focus a lot of the time on research.

                I started by looking at the existing app, mapping out the core flows and designing basic wireframes.

        <p>
            The good thing about starting with the app was that we always wanted to take the mobile first approach to designing the web app as over 70% of our patients used a mobile to access the web app. This meant that apart from a few mobile only features and design specifics, we could use the majority of the components designed for mobile, for the web app.

            Design
        </h2>

        <p class="intro">
            I wanted to keep the design as clean and minimal as possible. I wanted to ensure that the app didn&rsquo;t appear to be designed for a specific audience. Our product had such a broad target audience of anyone who has repeat prescriptions, so the design had to cater to everyone.

            Conclusion
        </h2>

        <p class="intro">
            After the app was designed and a lot of progress had been done on the front end development of the app, issues on the backend caused the project to stop. Due to a lot of different circumstances we couldn&rsquo;t proceed with the development of the app because the old backend system was unable to handle many of the new requirements of the new system.
        </p>

        <p class="noMargin">
            This meant that we would need to stop work on the app and start working on the admin area. A decision that we should have made from the beginning but unfortunately we were occupied with making a shiny new patient facing app.
